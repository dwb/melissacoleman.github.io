Tremor is a dress that responds with an involuntary visual shiver every time a woman dies as the result of an unsafe abortion. The dress is inspired by our ability to measure the seismic waves produced by an earthquake all across the planet. It emphasizes our interconnectedness: in the words of Audre Lorde, “I am not free while any woman is unfree”.

The design was created to support She Decides, a Foundation recently launched by the Dutch Minister Lilianne Ploumen, which aims to ensure access to sexual health and family planning worldwide.
